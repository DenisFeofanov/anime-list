  <p class="description">
    Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans
    are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour
    human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than
    as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling
    themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the
    biggest of titans.<br /><br />Flash forward to the present and the city has
    not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister
    Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a
    colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the
    city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows
    that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.
